1.what are the imp. feature of jdk 8?
Ans.plateformindependent,robust,secure

2.what is jvm.Is it plateform independent?
Ans. -jvm stands for Java Virtual Machine
     -jvm is used to run bytecode.
     yes jvm is plateform independent

3.what is diff b/w jdk jre and jvm?

4.which class is super class of all the classes
ans java.lang

5.why java doesnt support multiple inheritence?
Ans.In multiple inheritence one class can inherit the properties of the two or more classes,and we call the properties of the inherited class sometimes it creates ambiguty error.

6.why java is not pure oops lang.
java is not a pure oops lag.because it contains primitive data types
Ans.Java does not contain the feature of pointers

7.diff b/w overloading and overriding.can we overload the main method?
ans.Overloading can be applied on constructors and methods.
   -In method overloading the name of the methods should be same   but the paremetres should be different.
   -In constructor overloading the name of the constructor is as    that of class and we call the parameterised constructor in    default constructor by using this key word.
  -In method overriding the name of the method can be diffrent but    the parametre should be same.

  No we can not overload the main method.
8.what are diffrent access modifire explian with practicle example
   diff b/w access modifire and identifire.
Ans. There are the types of access modifires that are public,protected and private
 Public can be accessed any where.
 Private is accessed only within the class.
 Protected is accessed within the class and the class which inherit its feature.
9.diff b/w final and static keyword?
Ans.final is a keyword which is used to make the value remain same throughout the program.
Static

10.can we declare a class as static?
Ans. Yes we can declare a class as Ststic.

11.diff b/w abstract classes and interfaces
Ans.Interfaces contain the methods without its body.
Abstract classes does not have objects and it can caontain methods with body and without body.

12.what is wrapper classes
13.what are aynonms class
14.what is ternariy opertator explain with ex.
explain super,this,garbage collection,pass by value,pass by reference
15.WAp to print the duplicate elements of an array.
Ans.

package DEMO;

public class DuplicateValue 


{
	int num[]= {20,16,24,24};
	
	public void check()
	{ 
	 for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
		{
		  for( int i=0;i<3-j;i++)
		 {
			if(num[i]==num[i+1])
			{
				System.out.println("Duplicate value is"+num[i]);
			}
		 }
		
		
		}
	}
	
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		DuplicateValue ob=new DuplicateValue();
		ob.check();

	}

}
16.wap to check a string is palindrome or not.
package DEMO;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class StringPalindrome
{int i,len;
	String a ,b="";
	Scanner ob=new Scanner(System.in);
	public void check()
	{ 
		System.out.println("Enter a string");
		a=ob.next();
		
		len=a.length();
		
	 for(int i=len-1;i>=0;i--)
		{
		 b=b+a.charAt(i);
		 
		} 
		  
			if(a.equals(b))
			{
				System.out.println("String is palindrome");
			}
			else
			{
				System.out.println("String is not palindrome");
		 
		
		
		}
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StringPalindrome ob=new StringPalindrome();
		ob.check();
		
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}

17.wap to print triangle
15.wap to print series of prime no. b/w 1-100.
Ans

package DEMO;


public class Primelist {
	int n=100,i,j;
	public void acc()
	{
		for(i=2;i<=n;i++)
		{
			for(j=2;j<i;j++)
			{
				if(i%j==0) 
				{
					break;
				}
			}
			if(i==j)
			{
			System.out.println("\n"+i);
			}
		}
	
	
}


public static void main(String ar[])
{
	Primelist ob=new Primelist();
	ob.acc();
}}
